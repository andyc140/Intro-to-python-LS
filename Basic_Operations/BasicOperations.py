# Concatenate two strings, one with your first name and one with your last, to create a new string with your full name as its value

# print('Andy' + ' Christopher')

# Use the REPL and the arithmetic operators to extract the individual digits of 4936:

# One place is 6.
# Tens place is 3.
# Hundreds place is 9.
# Thousands place is 4.

#num = 4936
#print(num % 10)

#print(num % 100 // 10)

#print(num % 1000 // 100)

#print(num // 1000)

#Refactor the code from the previous exercise to use coercion to print 15 instead

#print(5 + 10)

#Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length?
#Yes, an error will occur: list index out of range. When you use an index value with no corresponding element, Python raises an IndexError error.

#What will the following code do? Why?
#print(int('3.1415'))
#It raises a ValueError since the string value 3.1415 does not represent a valid integer.

#To what value does the following expression evaluate?
#print('12' < '9')
#The expression evaluates as True since the operands are strings, not numbers. Python performs a character-by-character comparison from left to right when comparing string values. Thus, on the first comparison, it determines that '1' < '9', so '12' must be less than '9'.
#If you used numbers instead of strings, the expression would be False.
